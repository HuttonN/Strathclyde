2. What are the factors we can use to authenticate the user
</summary>

When we look at authentication, specifically user authentication, there are typically three different factors which we could use to authenticate the user. We have 
* **Knowledge:** something you know. Typically a text-based password, but there are alternatives
* **Biometrics:** something you have. Aspects such as fingerprints, iris, retina, or even voice recognition.
* **Tokens:** something you are. Although these tend to be used less often, these can be, for example, access cards which only you should have access to.

5. What, must be satisfied for it to be MFA
</summary>

* To be MFA, they must come from two seperate factor categories. So you could have a form of biometrics as well as a password or a token as well as a password or a token and biometrics and so forth. 
* Two passwords by technicalities doesn't really count as multifactor authentication.

The drawback with MFA is usability. It's down to the end user to decide are they more interested in the security and willing to give up the ease of having only a single factor there?
