<details>
<summary>
1. What is threat modelling?
</summary>

Threat modelling is a systematic and structured approach to identifying potential threats to a system, assessing their impact, and devising mitigation strategies.

2. Why is threat modelling important?
</summary>

- It helps avoid ad hoc, error-prone approaches to security.
- Provides a structured way to evaluate threats, impacts, and mitigation techniques.
- Addresses the growing range of attacks due to increased network accessibility.

## The Threat Modelling Process

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>
1. What are the four questions addressed by the threat modelling process?
</summary>

1. What are we building?  
2. What can go wrong?  
3. What will we do about it?  
4. How can we reflect and revise the process?
</details>

2. What activities are involved in the "What are we building?" stage?
</summary>

Activities include:
- Exploring and explaining the system.
- Creating diagrams, such as:
  - Component diagrams.
  - Class diagrams.
  - Data flow diagrams.
</details>

3. How does the "What can go wrong?" stage identify threats?
</summary>

- Brainstorm potential threats and attacks, such as denial of service (DoS).
- Use frameworks to structure discussions, such as:
  - STRIDE
  - Cyber Kill Chains
  - Attack Trees
</details>

4. What is involved in the "What will we do about it?" stage?
</summary>

- Identify and evaluate mitigation techniques.
- Prioritise and implement the selected techniques.
</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>
5. Why is reflection and revision an essential part of threat modelling?
</summary>

- To review the process and performance.
- To revise mechanisms, policies, and procedures as necessary for improving security.

## Key Takeaway

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>
1. Why is it said that "security is a process, not a product"?
</summary>

Because security evolves with the system and its environment, requiring continuous evaluation and adaptation.
