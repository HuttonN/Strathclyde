# Threat Modelling

## Introduction

Threat modelling is a **systematic and structured approach** to identifying the threat landscape for a given context, such as:
- An application being developed by a software team.
- A part or the entirety of a system.

### Definition

- **Threat Modelling**: A systematic way of identifying potential threats to a system, assessing their impact, and devising mitigation strategies.
- **Systematic Approach**:
  - Clearly defined and repeatable steps.
  - Helps avoid missing important elements.
- **Threat Landscape**:
  - The range of potential attacks that could target a system in the current environment.

## Why Threat Modelling?

- **Evolving Threats**: Systems and information are increasingly accessible via networks, such as the internet, exposing them to a growing range of attacks.
- **Defender's Challenge**:
  - Attackers only need to exploit one vulnerability.
  - Defenders must secure all vulnerabilities.
- **Structured Security**:
  - Avoids ad hoc, error-prone approaches.
  - Provides a systematic way to evaluate threats, impacts, and mitigation techniques.

## The Threat Modelling Process

Threat modelling typically answers four key questions:

1. **What are we building?**
   - Activities include:
     - Exploring and explaining the system.
     - Creating diagrams, such as:
       - Component diagrams.
       - Class diagrams.
       - Data flow diagrams.

2. **What can go wrong?**
   - Brainstorm potential threats and attacks, such as denial of service (DoS).
   - Use frameworks to structure discussions:
     - **STRIDE**
     - **Cyber Kill Chains**
     - **Attack Trees**

3. **What will we do about it?**
   - Identify and evaluate mitigation techniques.
   - Prioritise and implement the selected techniques.

4. **Reflection and Revision**
   - Review the process and performance.
   - Revise mechanisms, policies, and procedures as necessary.

## Key Takeaway

Threat modelling ensures a **structured evaluation of threats** rather than an unorganised, ad hoc approach.

### Security Perspective

A quote from Bruce Schneier encapsulates the philosophy:
> "Security is a process, not a product."

Threat modelling is an ongoing process that evolves with the system and its environment.
