# Malware Overview - Questions

## Types of Malware

### Viruses

#### Definition

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What is a computer virus?</summary>

A computer virus is malicious executable code that self-propagates by attaching itself to a host document, such as executable files, Unix shell scripts, Windows batch files, macros, or office documents like Word files and PDFs.

</details>

#### Lifecycle of a Virus

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What are the main steps in the lifecycle of a virus?</summary>

1. **Attachment:** The virus attaches to an uninfected host file or document.  
2. **Propagation:** The virus multiplies by attaching itself to more uninfected files, checks for infection, and may mutate to avoid detection.  
3. **Execution:** The virus runs its code when the infected file is opened and begins propagating further.  

</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>2. Why do viruses check if a file is already infected?</summary>

To avoid repeatedly attaching themselves, which could increase the file size and make detection easier.

</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>3. What is a polymorphic virus, and why is it significant?</summary>

A polymorphic virus mutates as it propagates, making it harder to detect since it avoids consistent patterns that antivirus software searches for.

</details>

#### Components of a Virus

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What are the three main components of a virus?</summary>

1. **Concealment:** Hides itself from detection.  
2. **Propagation:** Finds and infects files, adding a signature to mark infections.  
3. **Payload:** Executes actions unrelated to concealment or propagation, such as data theft.

</details>

#### Virus Classification

##### By Trigger Type

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What is the difference between a logic bomb and a time bomb virus?</summary>

* **Logic Bomb:** Triggers under specific conditions (e.g., no account activity for 30 days).  
* **Time Bomb:** Triggers at a specific date or time (e.g., Priscilla virus on December 25th).

</details>

##### By Infection Mechanism

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. List five infection mechanisms for viruses.</summary>

1. **File Infector:** Embeds in .exe files.  
2. **Boot Sector:** Embeds in the boot sector of disks.  
3. **Email Virus:** Attached to emails.  
4. **Macro Virus:** Attached to macros in documents.  
5. **Operating System Virus:** Attaches to OS files.

</details>

### Worms

#### Methods of Propagation

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. How do worms propagate without user interaction?</summary>

Worms use a network to send copies of themselves to other machines by exploiting vulnerabilities in applications and protocols, such as remote access (e.g., SSH) or software bugs.

</details>

#### Examples

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What did the Blaster worm do?</summary>

The Blaster worm spread across networks, forced computers to constantly reboot, and caused a distributed denial of service on the Windows website.

</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>2. Why is the Witty worm notable?</summary>

It was the first widely propagated internet worm with a destructive payload. It exploited firewall flaws, deleted hard drive sections, and rendered machines unusable.

</details>

### Trojans

#### Key Loggers

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What is a key logger, and why is it dangerous?</summary>

A key logger logs all keystrokes on an infected machine, potentially capturing sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

</details>

#### RATs

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT)?</summary>

A RAT includes a backdoor that allows attackers to bypass normal authentication, gain remote control of an infected system, and hide malicious activity.

</details>

## Malware Detection and Prevention

### Antivirus Approaches

#### Virus Dictionaries

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. How do virus dictionaries work?</summary>

They search files on a computer for signatures associated with known viruses.

</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>2. What are two limitations of virus dictionaries?</summary>

1. They cannot detect unknown viruses without a signature in the dictionary.  
2. They struggle to recognize polymorphic viruses that modify themselves to avoid detection.

</details>

#### Integrity Checkers

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What is the purpose of an integrity checker?</summary>

To identify changes to files that may result from a virus, such as a very old file being recently modified.

</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>2. What is the primary downside of integrity checkers?</summary>

They can only detect viruses after some damage has occurred.

</details>

#### Activity Monitoring

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>1. What suspicious behaviours might activity monitoring detect?</summary>

1. Programs trying to write executable code to other programs.  
2. Changes to program length.  
3. Slower program execution or system startup times.

</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>2. What does quarantining a file involve?</summary>

Quarantining isolates a suspicious file or program in a location where it cannot impact the system. The user can later decide to remove or restore it.

</details>

&nbsp;
<details>
<summary>3. What is a sandbox, and how does it relate to quarantining?</summary>

A sandbox is an isolated environment where changes made by a program are not saved outside the sandbox. This prevents malware from affecting the main operating system.
