<p>Complete the following questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the difference between a virus and a worm?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Virus needs human interaction to propagate – worm is self-propagating and doesn’t need user interaction</em></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Why are worms potentially more dangerous than viruses?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Linked to 1, they have more potential to propagate easier, hence more potential for destruction.</em></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Certain worms propagate on the internet do not cause any damage on the computers they hit, so why are they considered malware? Provide an example of such a worm</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Because they can have impact by consuming resources, e.g. the Morris worm brought down the network at MIT</em></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>How could an attacker install a backdoor?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>One possibility is through a Trojan horse</em></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>What is a Trojan horse?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Software which looks legit (and behaves that way) but also has a hidden malicious payload like a backdoor</em></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Think of a scenario of how an attacker could deploy a Trojan horse.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Any scenario which could result in the installation of a Trojan horse is acceptable. One such example is an attacker could create a game and put it on a store (e.g GooglePlay) for people to download, alternatively put an enticing piece of software on a visible website for users to download.</em></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Describe two techniques which could be used to help disguise a virus from antivirus software</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Polymorphic viruses (uses encryption), zero day</em></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>A dictionary based antivirus can recognise the signatures of all known viruses. Why might the computer still be prone to infection?</li>
</ol>
<p><em>It could be a zero day virus so there’s no signature in the database, or it could be a polymorphic virus, alternatively it could also be that the user hasn’t updated their virus signatures database</em></p>
<h2 id="scenario-based-questions">Scenario-based Questions</h2>
<h3 id="scenario-1">Scenario 1</h3>
<p>John discovered a virus in his office computer. The virus expert was called and took half a day to clean the computer and recover the data. The following day, the same virus came back. After spending several days fighting this virus, it was discovered that John himself unknowingly infected his computer immediately after each cleaning.</p>
<p>He had a game that he liked to play during his lunch break. His wife, a student, brought the game from college on an infected USB. Every time John inserted the USB into his office computer, the<br>
virus installed itself afresh.</p>
<h4 id="question">Question</h4>
<p>Given the above scenario, what actions do you think the company should take to prevent this happening again?</p>
<p><em>There are a range of options here, such as stopping external media being brought in, or sensitive parts of the hard disk could be write protected or ensure all external media should be run in sandboxes. A strong answer to this question would provide a way in which the above situation could not occur again and provide reasoning for the choice.</em></p>
<h3 id="scenario-2">Scenario 2</h3>
<p>You have discovered malware on your system. After analysing it, you notice its behaviour is as follows. After infecting your machine by attaching itself to a file, every Monday a message appears on your screen at 9am with a picture of a cat called Garfield saying ‘I hate Mondays’. It sends itself out to all your mail contacts.</p>
<h4 id="question-1">Question</h4>
<p>a) What type of malware is this and why?</p>
<p><em>This is most likely a virus as it attaches itself to a file.</em></p>
<p>b) What could the impact of this malware be if it were on an organisation’s network?</p>
<p><em>Could overload mail servers resulting in lack of availability, impact on time of staff, could impact on reputation</em></p>
<p>c) What is the trigger for this malware and how would you classify it?</p>
<p><em>This is likely a time bomb, the trigger is 9am on Monday mornings</em></p>
<p>d) What is an alternative trigger type? Provide an example.</p>
<p><em>logic bomb is the other trigger type discussed in class, there are a range of acceptable answers e.g. staff member has not logged in in 10 days then delete files</em></p>
