# Conditions and loops

## Logic conditions

## Loops

Python loops allow us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.

In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.

The following diagram illustrates a loop statement:

We will look at the following types of loop:
* for loop
* while loop

and the following loop control statements
* continue statements
* break statements
* pass statements

### For loops

#### For loop with Tuples

#### For loop with Lists

#### For loop with Range objects

#### For loop with Dictionaries

### While loops

### Loop control statements

Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.

Python supports continue, break and pass statements

#### Continue statements

#### Break statements
