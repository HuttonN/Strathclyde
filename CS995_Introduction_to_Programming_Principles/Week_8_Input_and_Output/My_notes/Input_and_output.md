# Input and Output in Python

## Introduction

* **Scope:** Focus on basic input and output (I/O) operations; not covering complex formats like Excel or databases in this module.
* **Types of File Formats:**
    * **Text Files:** Readable by text editors, e.g., Notepad.
    * **Binary Files:** Encoded data; unreadable by text editors.
* **Beyond Files:**
    * Databases (e.g., SQLite, relational databases with SQL, NoSQL like MongoDB).
    * Devices (e.g., sensors, motor drivers).
    * Network communications (e.g., sending/receiving data over Wi-Fi).

## File Operations Overview

### Working with File Paths

* Use absolute paths (start from root, e.g., ```C:\users\file.txt```) or relative paths (relative to current working directory).
* To ensure compatibility across operating systems, use ```os.path.join()```:

Example:

```python
import os.path

file_path = os.path.join("my_dir", "my-file.txt")
print(f"file_path=\"{file_path}\"")
```

### Checking File or Directory Existence

* Use ```os.path.isfile()``` to check if a file exists and ```os.path.isdir()``` for directories.

Example:

```python
import os.path

file_name = "my-file.txt"
exists = os.path.isfile("my-file.txt")
if exists:
    print(f"The file \"{file_name}\" exists.")
else:
    print(f"The file \"{file_name}\" does not exist.")
```

### Getting File Size

* Retrieve the size of a file using ```os.path.getsize()```:

Example:

```python
import os.path

file_name = "my-file.json"
file_size = os.path.getsize(file_name)
print(f"{file_name} is {file_size} bytes.")
```

## Writing and Reading Text Files

### Writing Text Files

1. Open a file in write mode: ```open('file.txt', 'w')```.
1. Write to the file: ```file.write("Content\n")```.
1. Close the file: ```file.close()```.
 
Example:

```python
output_file = open("written-file.txt", "w")
output_file.write("A text string" + "\n")
output_file.close()
```

### Reading Text Files

1. Open a file in read mode: ```open('file.txt', 'r')```.
1. Read the content:

    * Entire file: ```file.read()```.
    * Line-by-line: ```file.readline()``` or ```file.readlines()```.
1. Strip whitespace: ```.strip()```.
1. Close the file: ```file.close()```.

Example:

```python
input_file = open("written-file.txt", "r")
content = input_file.read()  # Read all lines of the file.
content = content.strip()    # Remove trailing new line.
print(content)
input_file.close()
```

## Working with CSV Files

### Writing CSV Files

1. Open a file in write mode: ```open('file.csv', 'w', newline='')```. Note: setting `newline=''` ensure that new lines are handled consistently regardless of the platform
1. Create a CSV writer object: ```csv.writer(file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)```.
    * `delimiter` is used to set the character for seperating columns or fields
    * `quotechar` used to quote fields containing special characters
    * `quoting` controls when quotes should be generated by the writer and recognised by the reader. `QUOTE_NONNUMERIC` means quote characters will be put around non-numeric characters
1. Write rows:
    * Header: ```writer.writerow(['Column1', 'Column2'])```.
    * Data rows: ```writer.writerow([value1, value2])```.
1. Close the file: ```file.close()```.

Example:

```python
import csv

output_file = open("my-file.csv", "w", newline='')
csv_writer = csv.writer(output_file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)
csv_writer.writerow(["Host", "IP"])
csv_writer.writerow(["localhost", "127.0.0.1"])
output_file.close()
```

### Reading CSV Files

1. Open a file in read mode: ```open('file.csv', 'r', newline='')```.
1. Create a CSV reader object: ```csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')```.
1. Iterate through rows: for ```row``` in ```reader```: ```print(row)```.
1. Close the file: ```file.close()```.

Example:

```python
import csv

input_file = open("my-file.csv", "r", newline='')
csv_reader = csv.reader(input_file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
for row in csv_reader:
    print(row)
input_file.close()
```

### Using ```DictReader``` for CSV

* Read CSV rows into dictionaries, using the first row as column headers (keys).

Example:

```python
import csv

input_file = open("test.csv")
dict_reader = csv.DictReader(input_file)
for row in dict_reader:
    print(row)
input_file.close()
```

## Working with JSON Files

### Writing JSON Files

1. Create a dictionary or list: ```data = {"key": "value"}```.
1. Open file in write mode: ```open('file.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8')```. `encoding = "utf-8"` ensures that any non-ASCII characters in the JSON data are written correctly.
1. Write using ```json.dump(data, file, indent=4)```. Writes the `data` dictionary to the JSON file in a readable format
    * `data` is the Python dictionary to be written to file
    * `file` is the file object where the JSON data is written
    * Optional: `ensure_ascii=False` ensure that non-ASCII characters are written as-is instead of being escaped (e.g. `Ã¼` instead of `\u00fc`)
    * `indent=4`: formats the JSON data with an indentation of 4 spaces for readability
1. Close the file: ```file.close()```.

Example:

```python
import json

hosts = {}
hosts["localhost"] = "127.0.0.1"
output_file = open("my-file.json", "w", encoding="utf-8")
json.dump(hosts, output_file, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)
output_file.close()
```

### Reading JSON Files

1. Open file in read mode: ```open('file.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8')```.
1. Load content: ```data = json.load(file)```. `load` reads what's in the file
1. Close the file: ```file.close()```.

Example:

```python
import json

input_file = open("my-file.json", "r", encoding="utf-8")
json_data = json.load(input_file)
input_file.close()
print(json_data)
```

## Error Handling and Best Practices

### File Cursors

* Files are read line-by-line; the cursor tracks the current position.
* Reposition cursor using ```.seek()```.

#### Example:

Suppose we have the following CSV file:

```
This file contains some CSV information...
{}
!!
"Name","Score","Day"
"Frank",65,"Monday"
"Sally",70,"Tuesday"
```

The first three lines aren't in the same format as the rest. To work with it, we can use the following:

```python
import csv


def seek_comma(text_io):
    """
    A function to advance the file position to the
    first line that contains a comma.  The function
    returns False if the end-of-file is reached.
    """
    # Advance to the first line that contains a comma.
    while True:
        # Get the current position of the file cursor.
        position = text_io.tell() # tell() returns the current file position in a file stream (the position of the cursor)

        # Read one line.
        line_text = text_io.readline() # readline() returns one line form a file

        # Check if the end of file has been reached.
        if len(line_text) == 0:
            return False

        # Check if the line contains a comma.
        if "," in line_text:
            # Rewind to start of line.
            text_io.seek(position)
            return True

"""
A program to demonstrate using the file cursor
to avoid reading the inital section of a file.
"""
input_file = open("bad_file.csv", "r", newline='')
if seek_comma(input_file): # searches for the first line in the file that contains a comma and move the file cursor to the beginning of that line
    csv_reader = csv.reader(input_file, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
input_file.close()
```

### Validation

* Always check file existence before reading.
* Close file connections to free resources.

### Use of ```with```

* Automates file closing after operations:
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
```

### Dealing with Malformed Files

* Pre-read lines to identify valid content.
* Skip invalid lines using custom functions.

## Summary

* **I/O Basics:** Essential for handling text, CSV, and JSON files.
* **Modularity:** Integrate I/O operations into reusable functions.
* **Error Handling:** Close files, validate inputs, and handle edge cases like malformed files.
* **Further Exploration:** More advanced topics like databases and network I/O will be covered in future modules.
