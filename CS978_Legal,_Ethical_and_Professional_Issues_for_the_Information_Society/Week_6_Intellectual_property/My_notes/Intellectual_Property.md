## Types of Intellectual Property Rights

### 1. Industrial Property

    - Prevent others from making, using, or selling the invention, even if independently created.
  - **Trade Secrets**:
    - Relies on keeping information confidential.
    - Protection available for any competitively valuable information that can be kept secret.
    - Misappropriation occurs through industrial espionage or breach of confidentiality.

- **Trademarks**:
  - Commercial indicators of source, distinguishing goods and services of an enterprise.
  - Require registration in most countries.
  - Can be words, logos, symbols, sounds, or three-dimensional signs (e.g., McDonald's golden arches).

### 2. Copyright

- Covers literary, musical, artistic, photographic, cinematographic works, maps, technical drawings, computer software, and databases.
- Denoted by the symbol © (not essential for protection).
- Protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves.
- Usually extends for 50–70 years beyond the life of the author.
