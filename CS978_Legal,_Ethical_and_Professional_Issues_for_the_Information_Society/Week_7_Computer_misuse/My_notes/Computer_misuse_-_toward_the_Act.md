# The Computer Misuse Act 1990

## Introduction

Welcome again. In this session, we will unpack the **Computer Misuse Act 1990** that applies in the UK, including its amendments in recent years to address new forms of cybercrime.

## Overview of the Computer Misuse Act

The Computer Misuse Act defines three main offences:

1. **Unauthorized Access to Computer Material** (Section 1)
2. **Unauthorized Access with Intent to Commit or Facilitate Further Offences** (Section 2)
3. **Unauthorized Modification of Computer Material** (Section 3)

## Offence 1: Unauthorized Access to Computer Material (Section 1)

- **Definition**:
  - A person is guilty if they cause a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in any computer.
  - The access they intend to secure is unauthorized.
  - They know at the time that this is the case.

- **Explanation**:
  - This offence deals with the initial unauthorized access to a computer or network.
  - It's illegal to access any computer without permission if the offender knows the access is unauthorized.
  - The **onus is on the computer or network owner** to make it clear that access is restricted.
    - This is why many networks display **log-in banners** or require users to click an agreement confirming they are authorized to access the network.
  - **Intent**:
    - It does not matter what the user intends to do or actually does after accessing the system.
    - The mere act of unauthorized access is illegal.

- **Punishment** (originally):
  - Up to **six months** in prison or a fine of **Â£5,000**.
  - **Updated Penalty**:
    - Increased to **2 years** imprisonment after amendments.

## Offence 2: Unauthorized Access with Intent to Commit or Facilitate Further Offences (Section 2)

- **Definition**:
  - A person is guilty if they commit an offence with intent to commit or facilitate the commission of a further offence.
  - The further offence does not need to be committed on the same occasion or even be possible; intent is sufficient.

- **Explanation**:
  - Relates to accessing a system with the **intention of committing additional crimes**.
  - Examples include:
    - Accessing a network to undertake theft or fraud.
    - Accessing someone's internet banking to steal money.
  - Such actions would breach both **Section 1** (unauthorized access) and **Section 2** (intent to commit further offences).

- **Punishment**:
  - Up to **five years** imprisonment or a fine.

## Offence 3: Unauthorized Modification of Computer Material (Section 3)

- **Definition**:
  - A person is guilty if they do any act which causes unauthorized modification of the contents of any computer.
  - They have the requisite intent and knowledge that the modification is unauthorized.

- **Requisite Intent**:
  - Intent to cause modification that:
    - Impairs the operation of any computer.
    - Prevents or hinders access to any program or data.
    - Impairs the operation of any program or the reliability of any data.

- **Explanation**:
  - Encompasses activities like:
    - Spreading viruses or malware.
    - Deleting or altering data without permission.
    - Restricting access to others (e.g., ransomware attacks).
    - Logging into a system to change data.
  - It is immaterial whether the intended effect is permanent or temporary.

- **Punishment**:
  - Severity varies depending on the impact of the offence.
  - **Updated Penalty**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks now fall under this section, with penalties up to **10 years** imprisonment.

## Challenges with the Act

- **Evolving Nature of Cybercrime**:
  - New types of offences emerged that were not clearly covered by the original Act.
  - The Act needed updates to address modern cyber threats.

### Case Studies Illustrating Challenges

1. **R v David Lennon**:
   - **Background**:
     - Sent 5 million emails to a former employer, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
   - **Legal Challenge**:
     - Initially, the case was thrown out because sending emails was not deemed "unauthorized modification" under Section 3.
   - **Outcome**:
     - Lennon later pled guilty under Section 3.
     - Highlighted ambiguity in the Act regarding DoS attacks.

2. **R v Aaron Caffrey**:
   - **Background**:
     - Accused of launching a DoS attack on Houston's port authority.
   - **Legal Challenge**:
     - Claimed his computer was controlled by a Trojan without his knowledge.
   - **Outcome**:
     - Acquitted due to reasonable doubt.
   - **Implication**:
     - Demonstrated difficulties in proving intent and responsibility in cybercrime cases.

- **Punishments Considered Inadequate**:
  - Original penalties were seen as insufficient deterrents for modern cyber offences.

## Updates to the Act

### Police and Justice Act 2006 & Serious Crime Act 2007

- **Increased Penalties**:
  - **Section 1** offences:
    - Penalties increased from **6 months** to **2 years** imprisonment.
    - Offences became eligible for extradition from foreign countries.

- **Removal of Statutory Limitations**:
  - No time limit on when someone can be charged from the time of arrest (previous limit was 6 months).
  - No time limit on when someone can be charged after the offence occurred (previous limit was 3 years).

- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**:
  - Specifically made illegal under amended Section 3.
  - Punishment: Up to **10 years** imprisonment.

- **Hacking Tools**:
  - Made it illegal to distribute tools that could be "likely" used to hack into a network.
  - Punishment: Up to **2 years** imprisonment.
  - **Controversy**:
    - Concerns about impacting legitimate researchers and ethical hackers.
    - Has not been interpreted as applying to ethical hacking activities.

## Conclusion

- The **Computer Misuse Act 1990** remains a foundational piece of legislation in the UK for addressing computer-related offences.
- Amendments have strengthened the Act to better handle the complexities of modern cybercrime.
- **Stricter Punishments**:
  - Reflect the serious impact that cyber offences can have on individuals, businesses, and national security.
- **Ongoing Need for Adaptation**:
  - As technology evolves, legislation must continue to adapt to new forms of cyber threats.
