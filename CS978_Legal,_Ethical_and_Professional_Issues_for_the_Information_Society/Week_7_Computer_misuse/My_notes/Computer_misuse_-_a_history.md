# History of Computer Misuse

## Introduction

Welcome to this session, where we will discuss the **history of computer misuse**. We'll explore the reasons why the **Computer Misuse Act 1990** was deemed necessary by illustrating past computer crimes and how they were addressed by the law.

## Early History of Computer Crime

### Late 1960s and Early 1970s

- **Stealing Computer Time**:
  - Unauthorized use of large timeshare computers became prevalent.
  - Due to the high expense of these systems, stealing computer time for data analysis was considered a significant issue.
- **Digital vs. Physical Property**:
  - Digital property was not seen as equal to physical property.
  - This led to conceptual challenges in legally addressing computer-related offenses.

### First Computer Crime Laws

- **Florida (1978)**:
  - Enacted the first computer crime law after a betting scam at the **Flagler Dog Track**.
- **Canada (1983)**:
  - Introduced the first countrywide computer crime legislation.

## Computer Crime in the UK Before 1990

- **Application of Existing Laws**:
  - Criminal acts involving computers were prosecuted under existing legislation related to the specific crime.
  - This led to some **peculiar cases** due to the mismatch between traditional laws and new digital crimes.

### Examples of Laws Used

1. **Criminal Damage Act 1971**:
   - Used to charge individuals who deliberately deleted data from magnetic disks.
   - **Challenge**:
     - Courts had to interpret "damage" to include digital content, not just physical disks.
     - Notion of damage had to be redefined as "damage to the digital contents" rather than the disk itself.

2. **Theft Act 1968**:
   - Addressed the "abstracting of electricity" as a criminal act.
   - **Application to Computer Crime**:
     - Unauthorized use of a computer was equated to using electricity without due authority.
     - There was thought that criminals could be charged for the electricity they "stole" when using computers to commit crimes.

3. **Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981**:
   - **Case: R v Gold and Schifreen**:
     - Defendants **Robert Schifreen** and **Stephen Gold** accessed British Telecom's Prestel service (an early online information system) without authorization.
     - They acquired usernames and passwords to access the system.
     - Initially convicted on multiple counts of forgery.
     - **Outcome**:
       - Convictions were quashed on appeal.
       - The appeals judges stated:
         - "We have accordingly come to the conclusion that the language of the Act was not intended to apply to the situation which was shown to exist in this case."
       - Highlighted the inadequacy of existing laws to address computer misuse.

## Need for Specific Computer Misuse Legislation

- **Inadequacy of Existing Laws**:
  - Traditional laws were insufficient for addressing crimes involving digital property and computer systems.
  - Existing laws had to be stretched or reinterpreted to cover digital offenses, leading to legal uncertainty.
- **Unique Aspects of Computer Crime**:
  - Required a legal framework that directly dealt with unauthorized access and manipulation of computer material.
- **Technological Advances**:
  - The growth in computers and their ability to undertake transactions across international boundaries exposed significant gaps in the law.
  - There was a pressing need to effectively challenge and prosecute computer crimes.

## The Computer Misuse Act 1990

- **Background**:
  - Growing recognition in the late 1980s of the need for specific legislation to address computer misuse.
  - The case of **R v Gold and Schifreen** was a catalyst for new legislation.
- **Introduction**:
  - The **Computer Misuse Act** was enacted in 1990 in the UK.
- **Offenses Defined Under the Act**:
  1. **Unauthorized Access to Computer Material** (Section 1)
  2. **Unauthorized Access with Intent to Commit or Facilitate Further Offenses** (Section 2)
  3. **Unauthorized Modification of Computer Material** (Section 3)

## Conclusion

- The **Computer Misuse Act 1990** provided a necessary legal framework to address the complexities of computer crime.
- It acknowledged the unique nature of digital offenses and established clear definitions and penalties.
- The Act has since been amended to keep pace with evolving cyber threats and technologies.
