# Privacy

## Introduction

Perhaps the most famous definition of privacy was uttered by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in the case Olmstead v. U.S., 277 U.S. 438 (1928) where he defined privacy as 

*“The right to be left alone—the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.”* 

In more modern times, privacy has been interpreted as a right that we all should be entitled to expect to be defended. For instance, Article 12 of the UDHR states that:

*No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.*

Therefore, privacy is defined as a right that we all should be able to expect to be defended in law. However, the right of the individual to privacy is becoming an ever-increasing concern in the information society, as information about us can easily be exchanged between parties at the click of a mouse, across countries and continents. It is also extremely difficult to know when and if this occurs, and this poses major problems for any legislative body seeking to curb such excesses.
