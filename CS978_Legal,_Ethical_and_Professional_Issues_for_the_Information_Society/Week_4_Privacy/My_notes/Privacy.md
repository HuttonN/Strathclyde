# Privacy

## Introduction

Perhaps the most famous definition of privacy was uttered by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in the case Olmstead v. U.S., 277 U.S. 438 (1928) where he defined privacy as 

*“The right to be left alone—the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.”* 

In more modern times, privacy has been interpreted as a right that we all should be entitled to expect to be defended. For instance, Article 12 of the UDHR states that:

*No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.*

Therefore, privacy is defined as a right that we all should be able to expect to be defended in law. However, the right of the individual to privacy is becoming an ever-increasing concern in the information society, as information about us can easily be exchanged between parties at the click of a mouse, across countries and continents. It is also extremely difficult to know when and if this occurs, and this poses major problems for any legislative body seeking to curb such excesses.

## Defining privacy

### Privacy vs. Confidentiality vs. Security

Privacy differs from confidentiality and security; 
* ***Privacy:*** privacy is the overriding concept which involves the right to be left alone and the autonomy to determine with whom we share details of our personal lives or personal information. 
* ***Confidentiality:*** confidentiality is a narrower concept. Violation of confidentiality undermines privacy but privacy can be achieved without confidentiality in that you can choose not to share your information in the first place and thereby not entrust others to keep it confidential. 
* ***Security:*** Security is necessary to maintain confidentiality and therefore privacy, as stored data needs to be kept securely and be accessible to only those who need it for the purposes for which it was provided.

### Balancing Privacy with Other Values

Of course, privacy has also to be balanced against other values. As with other rights, there are trade-offs and competing rights and interests which need to be respected. 
* ***Economic interests:*** Economic interests may cause consumers to trade privacy for convenience such as occurs in credit card shopping. 
* ***Government needs:*** Efficient government requires personal information for taxation, health care, and the like. 
* ***Law enforcement:*** Privacy can also conflict with publicly accepted principles of law enforcement and public safety, as it is not desirable for the work of criminals or terrorists to remain private if they break laws and threaten wider society. 

### Modern Challenges to Privacy

It could be argued that privacy is beginning to become a potentially old-fashioned concept. The increasing desire of our governments and the businesses we use to know more about us is impinging more on our day-to-day lives. Registering for many web-based services sees us having to tick boxes to unsubscribe from mailings or to ensure we do not have our data passed on to “selected third parties.” Individuals and organisations increasingly have to spend money on spam and junk mail filters to attempt to ensure that their email inbox is not stuffed with inappropriate emails offering dubious services. Providing such security measures is at the very least an inconvenience, and at the worst offers the potential for personal information to be abused or misused.

## Further defining privacy

### Privacy and Autonomy

* **Definition**: *“right to be free from unwarranted intrusion and to keep certain matters from public view” (Law, 2015).*
* **Connection to Autonomy:**
    * Following on from the definition, privacy is also an important element in the autonomy of the individual. 
    * Autonomy: The capacity to make independent choices and decisions without external coercion.
    * Human interaction: Much of what makes us human comes from our interactions with others within a private sphere where we assume no one is observing. 
* **Impact on Self-expression:**
    * Self-Expression: The act of conveying one's thoughts, feelings, or identity to others.
    * Autonomy Enables Self-Expression: Having the autonomy to make personal choices allows individuals to decide how, when, and with whom they express themselves. 
    * If we are not able to trust that we are in a private space, then we may not be completely autonomous, we may hold back crucial elements of ourselves. 
    * Griffin's observation:
        * *“frank communication… needs the shield of privacy; it needs the restraint of peeping Toms and eavesdroppers, of phone taps and bugging devices in one’s house, of tampering with one’s mail or seizure of one’s correspondence” (Griffin, 2008, p.225).* 
        * Implication: Without a right to privacy, then, we are not able to be fully ourselves. 

### Effects of Monitoring on Autonomy and Identity

* Wack's insight:
    * Wacks also emphasizes the point that without a right to privacy, we are not able to be fully ourselves, by considering the issue of electronic monitoring of employees.
    * Quote: 
        * *“the slide towards electronic supervision may fundamentally alter our relationships and our identity. In such a world, employees are arguably less likely to execute their duties effectively. If that occurs, the snooping employer will, in the end, secure the precise opposite of what he hopes to achieve” (Wacks, 2010, p.4-5).* 
    * Implication:
        * Monitoring can undermine trust, affect performance, and alter personal identity.
    * Psycological impact: 
        * Quote: 
            * “knowledge that our activities are, or even may be, monitored undermines our psychological and emotional autonomy” (Wacks, 2010, p.4).
        * Result:
            * Continuous surveillance can inhibit personal freedom and self-expression.

### Privacy and Freedom of Expression

* Link between freedom of expression and autonomy:
    * Freedom of expression is also about autonomy and self-development. 
    * Barendt's argument: Barendt argues 
        * *“restrictions on what we are allowed to say and write, or…to hear and read, inhibit our personality and its growth” (Barendt, 2006, p.13).*
* Access to knowledge:
    * Achieving our potential as human beings is fundamentally about being able to seek out our own path, through access to knowledge that informs our worldview and way forward. 
    * Under this justification we can also see links between some other fundamental human rights such as the *“rights to freedom of religion, thought and conscience” (Barendt, 2006, p.13).*

### Privacy vs. Security

* Privacy can pose significant challenges to security. 
    * Potential misuse of privacy: If an individual is seeking to commit a crime or a terrorist act, then arguably privacy affords them more opportunity to do so.
    * Tension between rights: The dichotomy is the heart of the tension between a right to privacy and protecting the legitimate interests of others and the state.

### Privacy as a Qualified Right

* The point: It is important for us to understand is that privacy is a right qualified by other interests. 
* Explanation: What we mean by this is that other rights may take priority over it. 
* Rationales: This is an absolutely rational notion, since unrestricted privacy could entail individuals undertaking activities that potentially damage the interests of others or society in general. 
* Consequence: It does, however, reveal that there is a tension between what a person might expect regarding privacy and what may be deemed to be encroaching on the rights of others in doing so. Whether we recognise it or not, the intricacies of this qualification lie at the heart of the controversies we face in our professional practice. 

### Shortcomings of Privacy (According to Wacks)

Wacks identifies seven shortcomings of privacy that are important to consider:
1. Privacy is often perceived as an old-fashioned value: “an air of injured gentility”
1. It may conceal genuine oppression, especially of women by men, carried out in the private realm of the home.
1. It may weaken the detection and apprehension of criminals
1. It may hamper the free flow of information, impeding transparency and candour
1. It may obstruct business efficiency and increase cost due to the necessity to adhere to standards in the collection of personal information
1. From a communitarian viewpoint, privacy is individualistic and trumps community values
1. Withholding unflattering personal information constitutes a form of deception (Wacks, 2010, p.35-37).

### Legal Framework

* The law:
    * The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) states both the right to privacy, and the limits that can be placed on it. Article 8 states that: 
    * *“Everyone has the right to respect for private and family life, his home and his correspondence.”* Section 8 (2) of the ECHR covers the limits that are allowed to be placed on the right to privacy specified in 8(1): *“There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”*
* Meaning:
    * Any restrictions placed on the right to privacy by states must be lawful. There must be a legal basis for the intrusion, and it must be justified by existing legislation. Framed as they are we can see here a set of restrictions that advocate invasions of privacy only in terms designed to protect what are deemed to be the legitimate interests of others, whether in the body politic or in their own right.

## Towards the protection of data

### Background

* Data protection began to concern society in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the dawn of
new technologies made it possible for organisations to electronically store information on
individuals.
