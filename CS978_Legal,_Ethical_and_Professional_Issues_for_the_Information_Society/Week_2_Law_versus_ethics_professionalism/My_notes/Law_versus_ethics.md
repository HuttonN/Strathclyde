# Law versus ethics

STILL TO DO:
* Make notes on lecture video

## Introduction

These notes are devoted to the background to the UK legal system, the issue of legal jurisdiction, and the important disctinctions that exist between law and ethics.

## UK Legal System

The United Kingdom is split up into four sovereign areas, England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. As well as the parliament in Westminister that legislates both for UK-wide and English law, parliaments exist in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales that pass legislation for those territories. Despite this devolved situation, the parliament at Westminister remains ultimately sovereign, as many key areas that are legislated for are reserved for the UK parliament to preside over, such as foreign affairs, defence, terrorism, and immigration.
