## Traditional Philosophical Arguments for Freedom of Expression

### Importance of Unrestricted Access

- **Censorship**:
  - Restricting access to information or viewpoints is considered a form of censorship.

  - Ideas must be subject to scrutiny and debate to validate their truth and relevance.
  - **John Stuart Mill** emphasized that truth can only emerge from the free exchange of ideas and exposure to unopposed criticism.

## Key Voices in the Freedom of Speech Debate

### John Milton – *Areopagitica* (1644)

- **Quote**:
  - "Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties."
- **Significance**:
  - Advocated for the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.

### Thomas Paine – *The Age of Reason* (1794)

- **Quote**:
  - "I have always strenuously supported the right of every man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it."
- **Significance**:
  - Emphasized the importance of allowing differing opinions to preserve one's own intellectual freedom.

### John Stuart Mill – *On Liberty* (1859)

- **Argument for Individual Freedom**:
  - **Quote**:
    - "If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind."
  - **Significance**:
    - Stressed that suppressing any opinion is unjustified, regardless of the majority viewpoint.

- **The Harm Principle**:
  - **Definition**:
    - The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against their will, is to prevent harm to others.
  - **Implication**:
    - Individuals should be free to act unless their actions harm others.

- **On Silencing Opinions**:
  - **Quote**:
    - "The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is that it robs the human race... If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose... the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error."
  - **Significance**:
    - Argued that suppressing opinions hinders the pursuit of truth and understanding.

### Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. – *Schenck v. United States* (1919)

- **Clear and Present Danger Test**:
  - **Quote**:
    - "The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic."
  - **Significance**:
    - Introduced limitations to free speech when it poses a clear and immediate danger to others.

## Personal Responsibility and Societal Impact

- **Role of Individuals and Institutions**:
  - **MP Yvette Cooper** stated:

- **Collective Action**:
  - Emphasizes the need for societal efforts to address and mitigate online harassment and abuse.
