# The Information Society and Internet governance

## The nature of Internet governance

The success of the Internet has been unprecedented in human history. In December 1995 the Internet had 16 million users, and by June 2015 the estimate for users was 3.2 billion across the globe. Arguably, with its explosion in usage and impact, the original goals of the medium have been under pressure.

In 1996 the manifesto that overarched the early days of the Internet was published by J.P. Barlow ("A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace (1996)"). It included the following snippets:

* "Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I comefrom Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of thepast to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.”
* "We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth."
* .We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity."

Whether such grand notions for the medium were ever tryly real, there was certainly a feeling among early adopters and those who shaped the Internet that this was and entirely new paradigm shift in humanity, and one that would be free of governmental and commercial influences. As Lessig stated, "The claim for cyberspace was not just that government would not regulate cyberspace - it was that government could not regulate cyberspace."

The internet is goverend in a multi-structured way, with several organisations responsible for seperate aspects of it. These groups include:

* the Engineering Task Force (IETF)
* the Internet Architecture Board (IAB)
* the Internet Society (ISOC)

The mission and mandate of the Internet Society are focused on the education, empowerment and awareness of governments, businesses and the users around the world.

The internet ecosystem is described in the following image:

### Code is law

An important concept around Internet governance is the idea, proposed by Lawrence Lessig, that *code is law*. A unique aspect of the internet medium was that it was a system designed around computer code and systems architecture. This meant that those very things could be used to govern interactions within the system Every act performed on the Internet involves the use of code and a systems architecture to achieve the desired result, and that meant those things could be used to control the experience. This clearly gave those writing the code and designing and managing the infrastructure immense power to shape the Internet experience. Lessig argues that:

"the invisible hand of cyberspace is building an architecture that is quite the opposite of its architecture at its birth. This invisible hand, pushed by government and by commerce, is constructing an architecture that will perfect control and make highly efficient regulation possible. The struggle in that world will not be governments. It will be to assure that essential liberty are preserved in this environment of perfect control.”

In terms of code being law, Lessig clarifies his argument and the importance of that idea: “In cyberspace we must understand how a different “code” regulates— how the software and hardware (i.e., the “code” of cyberspace) that make cyberspace what it is, also regulate cyberspace as it is.” 

## Governance concerns

Cerf et al have observed that despite the desire of many that the internet remains an open and universal experience “over the last several years more and more governments and companies have been taking action to control the flow of information over the Internet”. As we will see below, this focus on the influence of governments and companies forms a significant tranche of the concerns over what has been called, *internet fragmentation*.

In his testimony on the future of the web to the US House of Representatives, Tim Berners-Lee identified three internet concepts that he argued were crucial to the foundation of the web:

1. **Universal linking:**
    * The ability for any piece of content on the web to be linked to any other, without restriction.
    * This ensures open access to information and promotes connectivity and collaboration.
1. **Open Foundation for Information-Driven Innovation:**
    * The web should allow for the free exchange of ideas and information, promoting innovation.
    * It emphasizes the importance of keeping the web as a space where anyone can create and share content driving innovation forward.
1. **Seperation of layers:**
    * The principle that the web's structure should separate different layers (such as infrastructure protocols, and content).
    * This separation ensures that each layer can evolve independently without interference, which supports the web’s flexibility and scalability.

Hill mirrors this analysis more broadly and argues that:

"early Internet engineers incorporated into the Internet’s architecture their belief that connecting people together and enabling them openly to share ideas was an objective that should be encouraged; consistent with that objective, the early designers insisted that governments should have a very limited role in regulating the Internet."

These ideas are potentially under challenge as the internet evolves, with arguments tha both the openess and the freedom from government intervention of the ideal internet experience are under threat.

Although Berners-Lee was talking specifically about the web, as one would expect given his role in its evolution, he is clear that the values that underpin the internet made the web a reality. Hill cites Berners-Lee again expressing his view that the laws of the internet should be akin to the laws of physics; namely that the laws that apply in one area of the internet should apply everywhere on the internet. The emphasis here, then, is on the internet where every netizen can be assured of sharing a universal experience. Hill contrasts this with what he believes is the developing fragmented internet and posits that there is a “fragmentation spectrum” with Berners-Lee’s concept of the universal experience at one
end, and an experience that is arbitrary, depending on location, at the other. The figure is
represented below (please note the misspelling of Berners-Lee’s name is Hill’s):

Hill acknowledges that it is difficult to place where on the spectrum the current internetexperience is, however, he cites several elements as dangers netizens need to be aware of less the placement on it is not to be towards the more reductive experience.

We will consider three of the issues raised in Hill's report. 

### Peering and Transit Agreements/Net Neutrality

Net neutrality is built around the idea that regardless of the source, internet service providers (ISPs) should provide access to all content without fear or favour.Increasingly net neutrality has arguably been under pressure as commercial concerns seek to cloud out traditional internet values. The increasing tendency for ISPs to offer valued-added services from partners related to their content runs the risk that they will favour this content over other content when providing services to their customers.
