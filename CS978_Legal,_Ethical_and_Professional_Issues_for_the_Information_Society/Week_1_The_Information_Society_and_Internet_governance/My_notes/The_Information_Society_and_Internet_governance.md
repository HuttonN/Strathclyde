# The Information Society and Internet governance

## Introduction

If you are part of what has been dubbed the Google Generation, it might be difficult to imagine a world before information was the main driving force of the world economy. Yet the emergence of the Internet, and preceding this, the information society, are relatively new influences in human history.

## What is the Information Society?

We are in a phase of history dubbed the 'post-industrial society' (Bell, 1973). Bell characterised this as a society that is increasingly moving from a reliance on the production of tangible goods to a reliance on the production and management of information.

Yoneji Masuda coined the phrase 'information society' in 1980, and said "the production of information values and not material values will be the driving force behind the formation and development of society". What he means is that what will drive socity will be the formation and management of the infrastructure that supports the information society. For example, the industrial revolution was supported by 

* canals,
* roads; and
* railway lines

This can be compared to the telecommunications and computing revolutions that have supported the growth of the networked society.

In a report on the emergence of knowledge production is the USA (1962) Fritz Machlup defined what he felt were the information industries:

* Education
* Media
* Information machines (Computers and ICTs)
* Information services (Software and online services)
* Other service activities (not for profit and research and development)

## Governments and the Information Society

## Information Policy and Strategy

The pretty much constant need of government and its agencies to catch up with technogical development and uses has tended to mean a piecemeal, reactive approach to policy and legislation. Few nations, therefore have a single information policy but rather a collection of (sometimes contradictory) policies on specific aspects. For example, governments in developed countries want to stimulate eccomerce because of its efficiency and effectiveness, its potential to reduce overheads, etc. However, the commercial organisations involved, while also recognising the benefits of eccomerce, are concerned about the confidentiality of transactions, protection of customer data (where they also have legal responsibilities), for example, and so wish to employ strong encryption techniques for this purpose. Governments, however, are worried that strong encryption could be used to hide criminal or terrorist activities and so are less favourably disposed towards it.

These issues and concerns are made worse by the number of actors which information policy requires. Consider the following examples of organisations and groups and their interests or involvement in one or more features of information policy:

* government: interested in economic development and an informed citizenry, while abuses of the technology are prevented; precise approaches will depend on ideology (freefom of information vs. censorship)
* political parties: ideological approaches to specific issues
* civil service: responsibility for ensuring implementaion of policy, but with its own vested interests (e.g. over freedom of information)
* private sector: encouragement of industry, research, use of e-commerce, marketing, etc.
* pressure groups: ability to use the technologies to promote interests
* professional associations: regulation of professionals involved, maintenance of relevant standards
* international bodies: international regulation and policies, development of international standards
* regulatory agencies: monitoring and control, implementation of standards

This list gives an indication of the numerous factors which have to be taken into account and partially explain the sometimes contradictory nature of information policies.

One way to remove some of the complexity and, more importantly, the contradictions would be to consider the key issues in information policy which impinge both on development of information resources at a national level and their exploitation, and then involve government deparments and so on as required. For example, in addition to involvement as appropriate in the technical infrastructure (e.g. the promotion of technical standards to ensure reliability and compatibility), governments need to address the following issues:

* ***freedom to publish information materials*** (i.e. what is and is not permitted?)
* ***protection of information and information rights*** (copyright and intellectual property, piracy, hacking, email scams, data protection rights of access balanced by rights to piracy)
* ***market development, including investment and export*** (e.g. pricing of information for basic provision or revenue generation for value-added services)
* ***availability of skilled people to exploit and develop information resources*** (educational and training programmes to meet society's needs)

Responses to these by the relevant bodies will, as we have suggested, depend on the ideological slant of the government of the day, and thus are liable to change with a change in government. Governments may also change theirstance on a particular issue in the light of public opinion or the working out of the legislation in practice. In the UK, for example, MPs tried to ammend the Freedom of Information Act because it could be used to reveal details of their expenses claims, memberships of other bodies and so on, claiming that the legislation might not protect private correspondence with constituents (Hencke and Mullholland, 2007)

Legislation can also, of course, be affected by major unforseen developments, of which the most recent affecting Europe and North America has been the so called 'war on terror'. Since 2001 this has led various governments to introduce new legislation in a number of areas that imping on information policy. 

## The legislative response

We can identify a set of legal and/or moral issues on which governments have legislated or created standards which, it is suggested,have implications for information policy and consequently for information and computing professionals in their daily working lives. These include:

* ***content*** (what is and is not permitted)
* ***piracy*** (is it a fundamental right? When might it be overridden by the state?)
* ***cyber-crime*** (using the internet to commit 'old' crimes and the rise of new ones)
* ***monitoring of use of e-resources*** (when does this become an infringement on privacy, and when is it justified?)
* ***protecting intellectual property*** (how do we do this on the web?)
* ***freedom of information*** (just how 'free' should it be?)
* ***human rights to privacy, to information*** (when can these be set aside and by what demands?)
* ***cyber-terrorism*** (how can we identify the ways in which terrorists are using the internet?)
* ***health and safety*** (are our computer terminals safe for staff and users?)

The detail of legislation on these issues will differ from country to country (a further complicating factor in the establishment of a consensus on the use of the internet and web). Consider the following examples:

* compare attitudes to content in the USA where it has constitutional protection under the First Amendment, with the German constitutional prohibition of content relating to Nazism and Holocaust denial
* look at the way China prohibits its citisens from accessing online information relating to the events in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
* In the UK recent riots in English cities saw calls from senior members of the current government to ban the use of social media and Blackberry Messenger services, as these were seen to be the mechanism for organising the riots.

Some of these issues (such as cyber-terrorism) are new, a direct result of the development of online resources, but in some cases (e.g. the protection of intellectual property) they have existed in relation to printed media for a very long time: the question has become one of whether we simply extend the exisitng legislation to include the new medium of the internet or develop new laws. Intellectual property rights protection is an example of ensuring that existing legislation, modified where required, is adequate to the task. 'Phising trips', in which users are tricked into providing personal information such as bank account details and passwords to websites marauding as legitimate ones, are new crimes and require new legislation (though one could argue that laws on prevention of fraud could cover such activities)

Below are some legal and ethical concerns related to the information society , and how their legal provision might impact on you as information and computing professionals (the relevant UK legislation is added in brackets)

* ***intellectual property rights:*** (Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988)
* ***privacy of personal information:*** (Data Prtotection Act 1998; Human Rights Act 2000; Investigatory Powers Act 2016)
* ***improper use of computer systems:*** using computers to hack into computer systems or to plan criminal or terrorist activites; (Computer Misuse Act 1990; Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001)
* ***local and national government activities and those of publicly funded bodies:*** provision of information in various formats; access to information; advice on access to information (Freedom of Information Act 2000; Human Rights Act 2000)

## The Digital Divide

Of immense importance is what has been dubbed the digital divide. Feather gives this topic a large treatment in his peerless work on the information society (2013) (READ!!!) In considering the digital digital divide it is important not only to consider it in a global context but also a local context. 

Focusing on the global issues firstly. and although the economies of the west are at the moment in somewhat of a bleak period, much of the growth of the late 1990s amd early 2000s was related to the possibilities afforded by the information society. Loans and other financial services have increasingly been offered by banks and financial institutions able to operate outside of their own country of foundation, and indeed this has been one of the key factors in the UK banking crisis, as the retrenchment of the foreign banks in the wake of the economic downturn has led to significant gaps in lending availability in the UK. This boom (and subsequent bust!) was possible because of the increasing sophistication of ICTs and tools for undertaking e-commerce and e-banking, leading to a global marketplace in financial services. Without an ICT infrastructure and the skills in their populace, developing countries have major challenges in benefitting from such economic advantages. On an even more basic level, developing countries also miss out on the social and educational benefits the information society brings.

Even in the so-called developed world, the digital divide is a sociological problem of great note. It is crucial as information professionals that we seek to play our part in addressing the issue of digital exclusion. Chapters four and five of Feather (2013) deal with the economic and political issues related to the digital divide.
