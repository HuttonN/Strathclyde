## Key Changes Under GDPR

<details>
<summary>
4. How has the definition of personal data expanded under GDPR?
</summary>

Under GDPR, personal data includes any piece of information that can make someone identifiable. This expansion means that even data like location data is considered personal data if it can point to a specific person.

<summary>
5. What are the requirements for obtaining consent under GDPR?
</summary>

Consent must be informed, specific, and given freely. It must be presented in a legible and clear manner without legal jargon. For sensitive personal data, opt-out tick boxes are unacceptable; instead, there must be a clear affirmative action (opt-in) from the individual.

6. What special considerations does GDPR have regarding children's data?
</summary>

For children under the age of 13, consent for processing their data must be given by parents or guardians. In the UK, this specifically applies to online services targeting children.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
7. What rights do individuals have under GDPR concerning access to their data and data portability?
</summary>

Individuals have the right to request electronic copies of their personal data free of charge. They also have the right to data portability, meaning their data must be provided in a format that allows them to transfer it to other data controllers.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
8. Explain the 'Right to be Forgotten' under GDPR.
</summary>

The 'Right to be Forgotten' allows individuals to have their personal data deleted when it is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected or if they withdraw consent. Data controllers must consider the individual's rights versus public interest when handling such requests.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
9. What are the breach notification requirements under GDPR?
</summary>

Organizations must report data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach if it is likely to result in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms. Data processors must inform data controllers without undue delay.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
10. What does 'Privacy by Design' mean in the context of GDPR?
</summary>

'Privacy by Design' means that data protection and privacy must be considered and integrated into the development of systems and services from the very beginning, not added as an afterthought. Organizations must demonstrate and document how they have incorporated privacy into their processes.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
11. Who are 'Data Controllers' and 'Data Processors' according to GDPR?
</summary>

- **Data Controllers**: Entities that determine the purposes and means of processing personal data.
- **Data Processors**: Entities that process personal data on behalf of the data controller.

GDPR provides clearer definitions and responsibilities for both roles.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
12. Under what circumstances must an organization appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) according to GDPR?
</summary>

An organization must appoint a DPO if it is a public authority, engages in large-scale systematic monitoring (e.g., tracking online behavior), or processes large-scale sensitive personal data (e.g., health records).

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
13. What are the responsibilities and requirements for a Data Protection Officer under GDPR?
</summary>

A DPO is responsible for overseeing data protection strategy and compliance. They must have expert knowledge of data protection laws and practices, be independent, report directly to the highest level of management, and not have any conflicting duties. They must be provided with necessary resources to fulfill their duties.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
14. List the six lawful bases for processing data under GDPR.
</summary>

1. **Consent**: The individual has given clear consent.
2. **Contract**: Processing is necessary for a contract with the individual.
3. **Legal Obligation**: Processing is necessary to comply with the law.
4. **Vital Interests**: Processing is necessary to protect someone's life.
5. **Public Task**: Processing is necessary for tasks in the public interest.
6. **Legitimate Interests**: Processing is necessary for the organization's legitimate interests, balanced against the individual's rights.

## The Six Data Protection Principles Under GDPR

<details>
<summary>
15. What is the principle of 'Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency' in GDPR?
</summary>

This principle requires organizations to process personal data legally and fairly, ensuring transparency with individuals about how their data is used. Organizations must identify valid legal grounds for processing and inform individuals in a clear and understandable way.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
16. Explain the 'Purpose Limitation' principle.
</summary>

Organizations must collect personal data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not process it further in a manner incompatible with those purposes. Any new processing must be compatible, have consent, or have a clear legal basis.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
17. What does the 'Data Minimization' principle entail?
</summary>

Data minimization requires organizations to collect and process only the personal data that is necessary for the specified purposes. Data should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is essential.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
18. Describe the 'Accuracy' principle under GDPR.
</summary>

Organizations must ensure that personal data is accurate and kept up to date. They should take reasonable steps to correct or delete inaccurate data without delay.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
19. What is meant by 'Storage Limitation' in GDPR?
</summary>

Personal data should not be kept in a form that allows identification of individuals for longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. Organizations should have policies for data retention and periodically review the data they hold.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
20. Explain the principle of 'Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)'.
</summary>

Organizations must process personal data securely by implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
21. What is the 'Accountability' principle in GDPR?
</summary>

The 'Accountability' principle requires organizations to take responsibility for complying with GDPR principles and to demonstrate compliance through documented evidence, policies, and procedures.

</details>

&nbsp;

## Comparison of Previous and New Principles

<details>
<summary>
22. How does the GDPR's 'Accountability' principle differ from previous data protection principles?
</summary>

The 'Accountability' principle is a new addition under GDPR that was not explicitly stated in previous data protection laws. It emphasizes the organization's responsibility not just to comply but to actively demonstrate their compliance with all data protection principles.

</details>

&nbsp;

## Conclusion

<details>
<summary>
23. Why is it important to incorporate privacy considerations from the outset when building services or applications under GDPR?
</summary>

Incorporating privacy from the outset ensures compliance with the 'Privacy by Design' principle, reduces the risk of data breaches, builds trust with users, and avoids potential legal penalties. It ensures that data protection is integral to the organization's processes.

</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
24. What steps should organizations take to ensure GDPR compliance?
</summary>

Organizations should:

- Understand and document the personal data they process.
- Determine and document the lawful basis for processing.
- Update privacy notices and policies.
- Implement 'Privacy by Design' in their processes.
- Appoint a Data Protection Officer if required.
- Ensure data subject rights can be exercised.
