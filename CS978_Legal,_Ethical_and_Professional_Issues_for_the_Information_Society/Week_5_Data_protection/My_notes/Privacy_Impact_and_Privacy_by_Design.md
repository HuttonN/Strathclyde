# Privacy Impact Assessment and Privacy by Design

## Introduction

Welcome to this session, where we're going to discuss **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** and **Privacy by Design**, especially around the GDPR approach to it. This topic fits into the wider discussion of privacy and data protection we've been covering in previous sessions.

## GDPR Requirements

Under the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, organizations are required to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to uphold data protection principles and safeguard individual rights. Privacy by Design is now a **legal requirement**, which significantly raises the stakes for compliance.

### Advice from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)

The ICO provides guidance on implementing Privacy by Design:

1. **Consider data protection issues** as part of the design and implementation of systems, services, products, and business practices.

2. **Make data protection an essential component** of the core functionality of your processing systems and services.

3. **Anticipate risks and privacy-invasive events** before they occur, and take steps to prevent harm to individuals.

4. **Process only the personal data that you need** for your purposes, and only use the data for those purposes.

5. **Ensure that personal data is automatically protected** in any IT system, service, product, or business practice, so individuals do not need to take specific actions to protect their privacy.

6. **Provide the identity and contact information of those responsible for data protection**, both within your organization and to individuals.

7. **Adopt plain language policies** for any public documents so that individuals easily understand what you're doing with their personal data.

   - *Tip*: Use readability metrics to ensure your policies are understandable to the widest audience.

8. **Provide individuals with tools** to determine how you're using their personal data and whether your policies are being properly enforced.

9. **Offer strong privacy defaults**, user-friendly options and controls, and respect user preferences.

10. **Use data processors that provide sufficient guarantees** of technical and organizational measures for data protection by design.

    - *Note*: Who you hire as a third party matters. Ensure they understand your legal requirements.

11. **Use privacy-enhancing technologies** to assist in complying with data protection by design obligations.

## Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

### Importance Under GDPR

A **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** is a process to help organizations identify and minimize the data protection risks of a project. Under GDPR, conducting a DPIA is expected, and organizations must be able to demonstrate that they've done this.

### Steps to Implement a DPIA

1. **Provide training** so that your staff understand the need to consider a DPIA at the early stages of any plan involving personal data.

2. **Ensure existing policies, processes, and procedures include references to DPIA requirements**.

3. **Understand the types of processing that require a DPIA** and use screening checklists to identify the need.

4. **Create and document a DPIA process** for your organization where necessary.

5. **Provide training for relevant staff** on how to carry out a DPIA.

6. **Use templates** available from reputable sources, such as the ICO.

   - *Tip*: Don't reinvent the wheel. Templates can streamline the process.

### When is a DPIA Needed?

A DPIA is required whenever processing is likely to result in a **high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals**. This includes:

- **Systematic and extensive evaluation** of personal aspects of individuals, including profiling.
- **Processing of sensitive data on a large scale**.
- **Systematic monitoring of public areas** on a large scale.

#### Examples Requiring a DPIA

- A **bank** screening its customers against a credit reference database.
- A **hospital** implementing a new health information database with patients' health data.
- A **bus operator** implementing onboard cameras to monitor drivers' and passengers' behavior.

#### Example Where a DPIA is Not Necessary

- A **community doctor** processing the personal data of their patients, where the number of patients is limited and processing is not on a large scale.

*If in doubt, consult a data protection professional or speak to the Information Commissioner.*

## Conclusion

- **Privacy by Design and DPIAs are now legal requirements** under GDPR.
- Utilizing advice from the **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)** is a useful way to stay up to date with requirements.
- Implementing Privacy by Design and conducting DPIAs demonstrates an **ethical approach to managing data**, as well as adherence to legal obligations.
