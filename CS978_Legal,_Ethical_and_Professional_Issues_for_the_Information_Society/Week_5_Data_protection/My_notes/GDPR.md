## Key Changes Under GDPR

### Expanded Definition of Personal Data

- **Personal Data**:
  - Any piece of information that can make someone identifiable is considered personal data.
  - Includes data like location data if it can point to a specific person.

### Consent

- **Informed Consent**:
  - Must be legible, clear, and not written in legal jargon ("legalese").
  - For sensitive personal data:
    - Opt-out tick boxes are unacceptable.
    - Consent must be a clear affirmative action (opt-in).
- **Children's Data**:
  - Consent for children under 13 must be given by parents or guardians.
  - In the UK, this specifically applies to online services.

### Right to Access and Data Portability

- **Enhanced Rights**:
  - Individuals can request electronic copies of their data for free.
  - **Data Portability**:
    - Data must be portable to allow individuals to pass it on to other controllers.

### Right to be Forgotten (Data Erasure)

- **Definition**:
  - Individuals have the right to have their data deleted if it's no longer needed or if the processing it was stored for is no longer taking place.
- **Considerations**:
  - Data controllers can balance public interest versus the individual's rights.
  - Potential for clashes that need careful handling in practice.

### Breach Notification

- **Mandatory Reporting**:
  - Required where a data breach is likely to result in a risk to individuals' rights and freedoms.
- **Timeframe**:
  - Must be done within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Data processors must inform data controllers without undue delay.

### Privacy by Design

- **Principle**:
  - Privacy must be a primary objective from the outset when building any service or application that will store personal data.
  - Cannot be an afterthought.
- **Implementation**:
  - Must be demonstrated and documented.
  - Evidence should show that privacy was considered from concept through execution.

### Controllers and Processors

- **Definitions**:
  - **Data Controllers**:
    - Entities that define the parameters of what data is needed and how it will be processed.
  - **Data Processors**:
    - Entities that undertake processing on behalf of the data controller.
- **Clarity**:
  - GDPR provides clearer delineation between controllers and processors.

### Data Protection Officers (DPOs)

- **Appointment**:
  - Must be appointed in cases of:
    - Public authorities.
    - Organizations engaging in large-scale systematic monitoring.
    - Organizations engaging in large-scale processing of sensitive personal data.
- **Qualifications**:
  - Appointed based on professional qualities and expert knowledge of data protection law and practices.
- **Role**:
  - May be a staff member or an external service provider.
  - Contact details must be provided to the relevant Data Protection Authority (e.g., the Information Commissioner in the UK).
- **Requirements**:
  - Provided with appropriate resources.
  - Must report directly to the highest level of management.
  - Must not carry out any other tasks that could result in a conflict of interest.
- **Impact**:
  - Created new job opportunities in data protection and information governance.

### Lawful Basis for Processing Data

- **Requirement**:
  - Must determine a lawful basis before processing and document it.
- **Categories**:
  1. **Consent**
  2. **Contract**
  3. **Legal Obligation**
  4. **Vital Interests**
  5. **Public Task**
  6. **Legitimate Interests**

## The Six Data Protection Principles Under GDPR

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**
   - Identify valid grounds for data collection and usage.
   - Ensure compliance with other laws.
   - Use data in a way that is fair, not detrimental, unexpected, or misleading.

2. **Purpose Limitation**
   - Be clear about processing purposes from the start.
   - Record purposes and specify them in privacy information.
   - Only use data for new purposes if compatible with original purposes, with consent, or with a clear legal basis.

3. **Data Minimization**
   - Ensure data processed is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary.

4. **Accuracy**
   - Take reasonable steps to ensure data is correct and not misleading.
   - Keep data updated as necessary.
   - Correct or erase incorrect or misleading data promptly.

5. **Storage Limitation**
   - Do not keep data longer than necessary.
   - Justify retention periods based on purposes.
   - Implement policies with standard retention periods.
   - Periodically review data held.
   - Respect individuals' right to erasure if data is no longer needed.
   - Longer retention allowed for public interest archiving, research, or statistical purposes.

6. **Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)**
   - Implement appropriate security measures to protect data.
   - Protect against unauthorized access, loss, or damage.

### Accountability Principle (Overarching Principle)

- **Requirement**:
  - Take responsibility for data handling and compliance with principles.
  - Have appropriate measures and records to demonstrate compliance.
