# Data Protection: From DPA to GDPR

## Introduction

Welcome again.

In this session, we're going to discuss data protection. We'll provide an overview of data protection legislation and what it seeks to achieve in terms of protecting the privacy rights of individuals. We'll explore key questions about managing the protection of personal data and examine the evolution from the Data Protection Act (DPA) to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## The Need for Data Protection Law

### Rise of Data Processing

- **Mid-1960s Onwards**: Increasing usage of data processing tools to store data on individuals.
- **1975 UK Example**: 
  - **220 Functions**: Involved electronic processing of citizen data.

  - **Technology**: Large systems with extensive hardware and data tapes.

### Privacy Concerns

- **New Approach**: Handling and categorizing personal data electronically was unprecedented.
- **Lack of Protections**: No rules or regulations to protect individuals' data.
- **Informational Privacy**: Emerging concept guaranteeing rights over personal information and its processing.

### Examples of Privacy Concerns

- **National DNA Database**:
  - **Size**: Over 4 million profiles in the UK.
  - **Innocent Individuals**: Half a million profiles of innocent people.
  - **Largest Database**: World's largest DNA database.

## Early Data Protection Legislation

### Germany's Pioneering Law

- **First Legislation**: Introduced in Hesse, Germany, in 1970.
- **Scope**:
  - Applied to all documents generated by public authorities for automated data processing.
- **Key Provisions**:
  - **Data Security**: Ensured data could not be accessed, amended, retrieved, or destroyed by unauthorized persons.
  - **Confidentiality Obligations**: Imposed on data processors.
  - **Individual Rights**: Allowed individuals to correct errors and apply for injunctions if unauthorized access occurred.

### Expansion Across Europe

- **Sweden (1973)**

## Approaches to Data Protection

### 1. Voluntary Codes

- **Definition**: Industries or professional bodies agree on standards and protocols for controlling access to personal data.
- **Examples**:
  - **UK Press Regulation**: Industry self-regulation.
  - **Direct Mail Industry**:
    - **Mailing Preference Service**: Opt-out for junk mail.
    - **Telephone Preference Service**: Opt-out for sales calls.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Effectiveness**: Depends on industry's commitment.
  - **Redress Mechanisms**: Limited options for public recompense if rights are breached.

### 2. Government Regulation Laws

- **Definition**: Legal frameworks define obligations for data handlers and rights for individuals.
- **Focus**: Ensures compliance through legal enforcement.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Legal Redress**: Mechanisms for individuals to seek compensation.
  - **Penalties**: Fines and sanctions for non-compliance.

### 3. Consumer Education

- **Definition**: Making citizens aware of good practices in controlling their own data.
- **Examples**:
  - **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)**:
    - **Personal Information Toolkit**: Educates the public about information rights.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Empowerment**: Helps consumers prevent misuse of their information.
  - **Awareness**: Informs individuals about their rights and how to exercise them.

### 4. Technological Solutions

- **Definition**: Solutions like encryption to protect data during transfer and storage.
- **Examples**:
  - **Encryption of Credit Card Details**: Common in e-commerce.
  - **Email Encryption Software**: Protects personal data in communications.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Government Concerns**: Encryption can hinder lawful investigations and surveillance.
  - **Balancing Privacy and Security**: Ensuring data protection without impeding law enforcement.

## Data Protection Principles

### Under the 1998 Data Protection Act

1. **Fairly and Lawfully Processed**: Data must be handled legally and ethically.
2. **Processed for Limited Purposes**: Collected for specific, explicit purposes.
3. **Adequate, Relevant, and Not Excessive**: Only necessary data should be collected.
4. **Accurate**: Data must be correct and up-to-date.
5. **Not Kept Longer Than Necessary**: Data should be retained only as long as needed.
6. **Processed in Line with Data Subject’s Rights**: Respect individuals' rights over their data.
7. **Secure**: Protect data against unauthorized access and breaches.
8. **Not Transferred to Countries Without Adequate Protection**: Restrictions on international data transfers.

### Updated Under GDPR

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: Process data legally, fairly, and transparently.
2. **Purpose Limitation**: Collect data for specified, explicit purposes.
3. **Data Minimization**: Only collect data that is necessary.
4. **Accuracy**: Keep data accurate and up-to-date.
5. **Storage Limitation**: Retain data only as long as necessary.
6. **Integrity and Confidentiality (Security)**: Ensure appropriate security of data.
7. **Accountability**: Organizations are responsible for compliance and must demonstrate it.

## Challenges with Data Protection Law

- **Fear of Penalties**:
  - Organizations may strictly adhere to laws out of fear, sometimes at the expense of ethical considerations.
  
- **Case Example**:
  - **2003 London Incident**:
    - An elderly couple died after their gas was cut off due to unpaid bills.
    - British Gas did not inform social services to avoid breaching data protection laws.
    - **Information Commissioner’s Statement**: Criticized the misuse of data protection as an excuse for inaction.
