# Digital Evidence

## Introduction

Welcome to this session where we're going to discuss **digital evidence**. We'll consider some of the important aspects of digital evidence, what it is, how it's gathered, the challenges involved, and some of the controversies surrounding it.

## What is Digital Evidence?

Digital evidence is any information of probative value that is stored or transmitted in digital form. It can support or refute theories of how an offense occurred and can address critical elements such as intent or alibi.

- **Definitions**:
  - **Chisum (1999)**: "Any data stored or transmitted using a computer that supports or refutes a theory on how an offense occurred or addresses critical elements of the offense such as intent or alibi."
  - **Carrier and Spafford (2003)**: "Digital data that establish that a crime has been committed, can provide a link between a crime and its victim, or can provide a link between the crime and the perpetrator."

## Sources of Digital Evidence

According to **Casey (2004)**, digital evidence sources can be classified into three groups:

1. **Open Computer Systems**:
   - Examples: The Internet, personal computers.
2. **Communication Systems**:
   - Examples: Mobile phones, telephones, email systems.
3. **Embedded Computer Systems**:
   - Examples: Microprocessors in appliances like washing machines, Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

## Characteristics of Digital Evidence

- **Replicability**:
  - Digital evidence can be replicated precisely down to the smallest unit (the byte).
  - Analysis is performed on a **copy** to preserve the original evidence.
- **Volatility**:
  - Digital data can be easily altered, deleted, or corrupted.
- **Complexity**:
  - Data can be hidden, encrypted, or spread across multiple devices and locations.

## Challenges in Digital Evidence

- **Rapid Technological Change**:
  - New technologies and devices continually emerge, requiring ongoing adaptation.
- **Volume of Data**:
  - Investigations may involve vast amounts of data.
    - Example: In a 2006 investigation into a transatlantic bombing plot, authorities seized:
      - 400 computers
      - 200 mobile phones
      - 8,000 storage devices
- **Technical Complexity**:
  - Interpretation and presentation of binary data are complex and may involve technical jargon.
- **Encryption and Concealment**:
  - Use of encryption and steganography to hide data poses significant obstacles.
  - Over 100 programs are available for steganography alone.

## Investigative Process

### Initial Questions

1. **Has a Crime Been Committed?**
   - Evidence may initially suggest a crime, but analysis could prove otherwise.
   - **Examples**:
     - A person accused of computer misuse who is found innocent due to errors in computer logs.
     - A suicide note dated after the supposed time of death due to a malfunctioning computer clock.

### Locard's Exchange Principle

- **Concept**:
  - "Every contact leaves a trace."
  - In digital forensics, this means that any interaction with a digital device leaves evidence.
- **Applications**:
  - **Email Harassment**: Leaves digital traces in email headers and logs.
  - **Illegal Downloads**: Logs and metadata can link activities to specific users.
  - **Unauthorized Access**: Hackers leave traces in system logs and network traffic.

## Principles and Standards

### ACPO Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence

The **Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)** provided key principles:

1. **No Alteration of Data**:
   - Data held on an exhibit must not be changed.
2. **Competent Handling**:
   - Any person accessing the exhibit must be competent and able to explain their actions.
3. **Audit Trail**:
   - A record of all processes applied to the exhibit should be kept.
   - The process must be repeatable by an independent third party.
4. **Responsibility**:
   - The person in charge of the investigation is responsible for adherence to the law and these principles.

### BS 10008 Standard

- **Purpose**:
  - Ensures the evidential weight and legal admissibility of electronic information.
- **Key Aspects**:
  - Secure storage of electronic information.
  - Integrity and authenticity of data.
  - Reliable and repeatable processes.

## Gathering Digital Evidence

1. **Imaging**:
   - Create a digital image (exact copy) of each storage device.
   - Use forensic tools to ensure bit-by-bit replication.
2. **Preservation**:
   - Maintain the integrity of the original data.
   - Document the chain of custody.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Perform examination on the copies.
   - Use specialized software to recover and interpret data.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep detailed records of all actions taken.
   - Ensure findings are reproducible.

## Legal Considerations

### Points to Prove

Under UK law, evidence must establish:

- **Actus Reus (Guilty Act)**:
  - The defendant committed an act which is prohibited by law.
- **Mens Rea (Guilty Mind)**:
  - The defendant had the intent or knowledge that their actions were wrong.

### Computer Misuse Act Offenses

- **Unauthorized Modification of Computer Material**:
  - Proving the defendant caused unauthorized changes to computer data.
  - Demonstrating intent and knowledge.

## Controversies in Digital Evidence

### Operation Ore

- **Background**:
  - A major international investigation starting in 1999 targeting individuals accessing illegal content online.
- **Statistics**:
  - 7,250 suspects identified.
  - 4,283 homes searched.
  - 3,744 arrests.
  - 1,848 charged.
  - 1,451 convictions.
  - 39 individuals tragically took their own lives during the investigation.
- **Issues**:
  - **Credit Card Fraud**:
    - The payment processor involved had been a victim of credit card fraud involving over 50,000 transactions.
    - Many innocent individuals were falsely accused due to stolen credit card details.
  - **Criticism**:
    - Authorities were criticized for handling the investigation poorly.
    - Raised concerns about the reliability of digital evidence and the importance of thorough verification.

## Conclusion

- **Complexity of Investigations**:
  - Digital evidence introduces unique challenges in forensic investigations.
  - The prevalence of digital devices increases the scope and scale of potential evidence.
- **Professional Opportunities**:
  - Growing need for specialists in digital forensics.
  - Importance of continual learning to keep pace with technological advancements.
- **Ethical and Legal Responsibilities**:
