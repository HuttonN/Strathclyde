# Cybercrime

## Introduction

Welcome to this session where we will discuss **cybercrime** and **digital evidence**. We'll delve into the definitions of cybercrime, explore the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime, and understand the various offenses classified under this convention. Understanding cybercrime is crucial for computer scientists and software engineers to appreciate the totality of potential cyber offenses and their impact on organizations and individuals.

## European Commission's Identified Risks for Internet Security

1. **Profit-Motivated Attacks**:
   - Shift from disruption for its own sake to organized, targeted criminal activity aiming for financial gain.

2. **Mobile Device Vulnerabilities**:
   - Increasing use of mobile devices poses new challenges.
   - Mobile devices may become more common targets than personal computers.

3. **Ambient Intelligence and IoT Risks**:
   - Ubiquitous intelligent devices (e.g., RFID, Internet of Things) create additional security and privacy risks.
   - Exploitation of shared vulnerabilities in interconnected devices.

## Cybersecurity and Expanding Liability

### Responsibility of Users and Organizations

- **User Awareness**:
  - Many users lack understanding of basic security measures.
  - Example: A UK study found 40% of people with Wi-Fi at home did not know how to change security settings.

- **Onus on Service Providers**:
  - Internet Service Providers (ISPs), software vendors, and financial institutions may bear responsibility for ensuring user security.
  - Argument that systems should be secure by default, minimizing the need for user intervention.

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

- **Liability of Unsecured Networks**:
  - Cases where individuals are held responsible for not securing their networks, leading to misuse by others.
  - Raises questions about the extent of user responsibility.

- **Fit for Purpose Systems**:
  - Legal expectation that products and services should be secure and reliable.
  - Vendors should provide software that is as secure as possible at basic settings.

- **Balancing Security and Usability**:
  - Enhanced security measures may introduce complexity and cost.
  - Need to find a balance that protects users without overwhelming them.
