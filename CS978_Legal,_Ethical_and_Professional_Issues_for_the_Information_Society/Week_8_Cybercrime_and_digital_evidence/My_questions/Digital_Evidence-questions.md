# Digital Evidence Questions

## What is Digital Evidence?

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
1. What is the definition of digital evidence according to Chisum (1999)?
</summary>

Chisum defines digital evidence as "any data stored or transmitted using a computer that supports or refutes a theory on how an offense occurred or addresses critical elements of the offense such as intent or alibi."
</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
2. What are the three categories of digital evidence sources according to Casey (2004)?
</summary>

1. Open Computer Systems (e.g., the Internet, personal computers).
2. Communication Systems (e.g., mobile phones, email systems).
3. Embedded Computer Systems (e.g., IoT devices, microprocessors in appliances).
</details>

&nbsp;

## Characteristics of Digital Evidence

<details>
<summary>
3. Why is replicability an important characteristic of digital evidence?
</summary>

Replicability ensures that digital evidence can be precisely copied down to the smallest unit (the byte), allowing analysis to be conducted on the copy while preserving the original evidence.
</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
4. What challenges does the volatility of digital evidence present?
</summary>

Volatility makes digital evidence easily alterable, deletable, or corruptible, requiring careful preservation and handling to maintain its integrity.
</details>

## Challenges in Digital Evidence

<details>
<summary>
5. How does the volume of data impact investigations involving digital evidence?
</summary>

Investigations often involve vast amounts of data, such as hundreds of devices and storage media, making the analysis and management of evidence time-consuming and resource-intensive.
</details>

6. How does encryption complicate the gathering of digital evidence?
</summary>

Encryption hides data, requiring specialized tools and expertise to decrypt it. Additionally, there are over 100 programs available for steganography, further complicating investigations.
</details>

&nbsp;

## Investigative Process

<details>
<summary>
7. What is the primary question investigators ask when examining digital evidence?
</summary>

The primary question is: "Has a crime been committed?" Initial evidence may suggest a crime, but further analysis might prove otherwise.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
8. How does Locard's Exchange Principle apply to digital forensics?
</summary>

Locard's Exchange Principle states that "every contact leaves a trace." In digital forensics, this means that interactions with digital devices leave traces such as email logs, metadata, or system logs.
</details>

&nbsp;

## Principles and Standards

<details>
<summary>
9. What are the four principles outlined in the ACPO Good Practice Guide for Digital Evidence?
</summary>

1. Data held on an exhibit must not be changed.
2. Any person accessing the exhibit must be competent and able to explain their actions.
3. A complete audit trail must be kept.
4. The investigation lead is responsible for ensuring adherence to laws and principles.
</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
10. What is the purpose of the BS 10008 standard?
</summary>

The BS 10008 standard ensures the evidential weight and legal admissibility of electronic information by focusing on secure storage, data integrity, and reliable processes.
</details>

&nbsp;

## Gathering Digital Evidence

<details>
<summary>
11. Why is imaging an essential step in gathering digital evidence?
</summary>

Imaging creates an exact bit-by-bit copy of each storage device, preserving the original data and allowing analysis to be conducted on the replicated copy.
</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
12. What is the importance of maintaining a chain of custody for digital evidence?
</summary>

Maintaining a chain of custody ensures the integrity of the evidence by documenting all actions taken, making it admissible and credible in court.
</details>

&nbsp;

## Legal Considerations

<details>
<summary>
13. What two elements must be established under UK law to prove guilt in computer misuse cases?
</summary>

1. **Actus Reus (Guilty Act)**: The defendant committed an act prohibited by law.
2. **Mens Rea (Guilty Mind)**: The defendant had the intent or knowledge that their actions were wrong.
</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
14. What must be proven to establish unauthorized modification of computer material under the Computer Misuse Act?
</summary>

It must be shown that the defendant caused unauthorized changes to computer data and that they had the intent and knowledge that their actions were unauthorized.
</details>

&nbsp;

## Controversies in Digital Evidence

<details>
<summary>
15. What was a major criticism of the handling of Operation Ore?
</summary>

Authorities were criticized for poor handling of the investigation, leading to false accusations due to stolen credit card details used fraudulently, and the tragic loss of lives during the process.
</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
16. How did credit card fraud complicate Operation Ore?
</summary>

The payment processor involved in Operation Ore had been a victim of credit card fraud involving over 50,000 transactions, resulting in many innocent individuals being falsely accused.
</details>

&nbsp;

## Conclusion

<details>
<summary>
17. Why is adherence to principles and standards critical in handling digital evidence?
</summary>

Adherence ensures accuracy, integrity, and legality in handling digital evidence, protecting the rights of all parties and making evidence credible and admissible in court.
</details>

&nbsp;

<details>
<summary>
18. What opportunities exist for professionals in digital forensics?
</summary>

Digital forensics offers growing opportunities for specialists as the demand increases due to the prevalence of digital devices and the complexity of cybercrime investigations.
