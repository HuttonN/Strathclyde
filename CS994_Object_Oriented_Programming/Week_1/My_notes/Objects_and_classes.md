# Objects and classes

When writing a computer program you can view it as a model of some part of the world. The parts that the model is built up from are the *objects* that appear in the problem domain. For example:
* if you are working on a word processor program, pbjects might be things like words or characters, sentences or paragraphs.
* if working on a video game, an object might be a character
* if working on a music app, an object might be an artist or album

Objects may be categorised. A class describes, - in an abstract way, - all object of a particular kind. Classes form generic descriptions of objects, deciding such things as what kind of behaviour they have and their characterisitics.

To make these rather abstract notions clearer lets consider the example of a car. 

All cars have certain shared properties, e.g. they typically have 4 wheels. they have a colour, they have an engine, etc. When we are talking about cars in general we are talikng of the *class* car.

If we look at a particular car, say a red 4 wheeled one, we are taling about an *object*. We usually refer to a particular oject as an *instance*

*Objects are created from classes. The class describes the kind of object; the objects represent individual instances of the class.*
