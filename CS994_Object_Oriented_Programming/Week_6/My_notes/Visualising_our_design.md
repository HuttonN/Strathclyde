# Visualising our design

## Communicating Design with UML

When designing software, it’s important to communicate the design effectively with team members and stakeholders. UML provides a visual way to communicate these ideas and designs.

### Why Use UML?

- **Team Communication**: Share and discuss design ideas during meetings.
- **Stakeholder Understanding**: Present a high-level overview of the design to stakeholders without delving into intricate details.
- **Visual Representation**: Diagrams often replace lengthy written explanations.
  - Can be drawn on whiteboards for quick presentations.
  - Useful for iterative review meetings to showcase progress.

## Reverse Engineering with UML

- **Code ↔ Diagram Conversion**:
  - UML diagrams can be generated automatically from code.
  - Existing code can be converted into UML diagrams for better understanding during team discussions.

## Levels of UML Diagrams

1. **High-Level Diagrams**:
   - Summarized sketches focusing on key objects and their interactions.
   - No details about attributes or class internals.
   - Ideal for quick presentations using whiteboards.

2. **Detailed Diagrams**:
   - Similar to blueprints.
   - Include detailed class attributes, methods, and communication between objects.
   - Used by programmers for implementation.

## Types of UML Diagrams

UML diagrams are grouped into two main categories:

### 1. Structure (Static) Diagrams
   - Describe the structure of the design.
   - Include:
     - **Classes** and their attributes (e.g., public or private).
     - **Packages** and their relationships.
   - Focus on the static aspects of the system.

### 2. Behaviour (Dynamic) Diagrams
   - Describe how different classes or objects interact dynamically.
   - Include:
     - **Activity Diagrams**: Illustrate system activities.
     - **Sequence Diagrams**: Show sequences of actions/events.
   - Focus on the dynamic aspects that change during execution.

## Standards and Variations in UML

- **UML Standards**: There is a standard way of creating UML diagrams.
- **Practical Variations**:
  - Teams and companies may adopt different methods of creating UML diagrams.
  - It's important for a team to stick to a single agreed-upon method.

## Course-Specific Notes

- For this course:
  - Follow the UML standards demonstrated in the videos.
  - Apply the methods shown for coursework and assessments.
- For personal projects:
  - You may adopt alternate approaches found online or in other resources.
