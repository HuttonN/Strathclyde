# Class diagram overview

## Overview of Class Diagrams

A class diagram is one of the most fundamental diagrams in UML. It represents all the objects (classes) in a system and the relationships between them.

### Key Components of a Class Diagram

- **Classes**: Represented as boxes divided into three sections:
  - **Name of the class**: Mandatory.
  - **Attributes**: Optional.
  - **Operations (methods)**: Optional.

- **Relationships**:
  - **Association**
  - **Aggregation**
  - **Composition**
  - **Generalisation**

## Detailed Representations in Class Diagrams

### Attributes

- Attributes can be **static** or **non-static**:
  - Static attributes are **underlined**.
  - Non-static attributes are not underlined.

- **Visibility Modifiers**:
  - `+` (public): Accessible by all classes.
  - `-` (private): Accessible only within the class.
  - `#` (protected): Accessible by derived classes but not others.

- **Multiplicity**:
  - Specifies how many values an attribute can have:
    - `1`: Exactly one value (cannot be `null`).
    - `0..1`: Zero or one value.
    - `1..*`: One or more values.
    - `0..*`: Zero or more values.

- **Default Values**:
  - Specify a default value using `= value`. For example, `= 0`.

### Methods

- **Format for Methods**:
  - **Visibility Modifier**: `+`, `-`, or `#`.
  - **Name of the Method**
  - **List of Parameters**: Includes parameter names and types (in UML, the format is `name: type` instead of `type name` as in Java or C).
  - **Return Type**: After `:`.

## Example of Class Diagram Syntax

### Attribute Format
`visibility name: type [multiplicity] = defaultValue`

### Method Format
`visibility name(parameters: types): returnType`

## Practical Use of Class Diagrams

- **High-Level Design**:
  - Focus on class names and relationships without specifying attributes or methods.
  - Useful for quick sketches or discussions.

- **Detailed Design**:
  - Include all attributes, methods, their types, visibility modifiers, and relationships.
  - Serves as a blueprint for implementation.

## Summary

Class diagrams are a versatile and powerful tool for visualizing and communicating the structure of a system. By including attributes, methods, and relationships, they provide a clear overview of the system's design. In future videos, we will explore more about classes and their relationships in class diagrams.
